I was experimenting with using [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) to see if I could coax it to make 'things in the shape of letters'. One thing led to another and in a couple of hours I'd generated a full alphabet of Dieter Rams-ian industrial design. So I whittled down the images I had and made a quick bosh through them... 

These are 'raw' from my home PC. I haven't itterated on them, post-processed them, or use AI-upscalers or anyhting. But for a quick test I was pretty impressed. But also slightly freaked out.

It's an example of just how much you can extract the influence of a particular artist / designer / creative from a generalised data-set. Even thought it's not been trained specially to know Braun design from the 1970s, it understands what it 'looks' like enough to have a good go at replicating it.

As a creative who has 'control over it it's pretty thrilling. But I guess so is spraying a flame-thrower around the place, until you realise you've made a terrible mistake ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¿.

As always, the technology is innocent. It's how people choose to apply it. Unfortunately it's an obvious racket to hoover up the world's creativity and flog it for $9.99 - and probably get acquired at some point. But poor Dieter won't get a bean.

Things are going to get pretty wild on this front over the next few months/years.  There's amazing potential to bring artists and tecnhologists together to create mind-blowing systems, tools and experiences. But only if people from enough different backgrounds and interests and value systems are invited into the process.

I love the idea that artists and creators could come together feeding into commmunity GANs that offer their talents to people they want to help. And get rewarded with franctional onoing ownership. Getting percentages depending on how much of their DNA flows through the Neural Network. 

Or something like that.
