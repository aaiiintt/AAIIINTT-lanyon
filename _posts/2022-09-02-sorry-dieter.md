I was playing with Stable Diffusion to make 'things in the shape of letters'. One thing led to another and in a couple of hours I'd generated a full alphabet of Dieter Rams-ian industrial design. So I selected a couple of hundred images and stuck them together. [There's a short (15s) video over on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/745606590).

I haven't iterated on them, post-processed them, or use AI-upscalers or anything. This is how they come out of my home PC 'raw'. It's funny because I can already feel how dated this is going to look in a few months.

This is an example of just how much you can extract the influence of a particular artist / designer / creative within a generalised data-set. I have mixed feelings about it.

As a creative who has 'control over it it's pretty thrilling. But I guess so is spraying a flame-thrower around the place, until you realise what you've done ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¿.

I'm not saying this stuff is *bad*. The technology itself is rarely at fault as the technocrats are fond of say. But we can already see people hell-bent on hoovering up the world's creativity and flogging it on subscription for $9.99. But poor Dieter won't get a bean!

Things are going to get pretty wild on this front over the next few months and years. I think there's amazing potential for artists and technologists to work together to create mind-blowing systems and tools and experiences. But only if enough people from different background, interests and value systems are invited into the process.

It may be the eternal stupid optimist in me, but the potential for artists to come together feeding into communal GANs. Systems that reward artists with fractional ongoing ownership of percentages depending on how much of their DNA flows through the Neural Network. 

Or some such nonsense.
