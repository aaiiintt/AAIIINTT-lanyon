I was experimenting with using Stable Diffusion to make 'things in the shape of letters'. One thing led to another and in a couple of hours I'd generated a full alphabet of Rams-ian industrial design. So I whittled down the images I had and made a quick bosh through them... 

These are 'raw' from my home PC. I haven't itterated on them, post-processed them, or use AI-upscalers or anyhting.

To me this is an example of just how much you can extract the influence of a particular artist / designer / creative within a generalised data-set. I have mixed feelings about all of it.

As a creative who has 'control over it it's pretty thrilling. But I guess so is spraying a flame-thrower around the place, until you realise what you've done ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¿.

I'm not saying this stuff is *bad*. The technology itself is rarely at fault. But we can already see people who are hell-bent on hoovering up the world's creativity and flogging for $9.99 and some Discord Nitro - and poor Dieter won't get a bean!

Things are going to get pretty wild on this front over the next few years. I think there's amazing potential for artists and tecnhologists to work together to create mind-blowing systems and tools and experiences. But only if enough people from enough different backgrounds and interests and value systems are invited into the process.

It may be the eternal stupid optimist in me, but the potential for artists to commune together feeding into collective GANs that reward artists with franctional onoing ownership of percentages depending on how much of their DNA flows through the Neural Network. Or something like that.
