I was playing with Stable Diffusion to make 'things in the shape of letters'. One thing led to another and in a couple of hours I'd generated a full alphabet of Dieter Rams-ian industrial design. So I selected a couple of hundred images and stuck them together. [There's a short (15s) video over on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/745606590).

I haven't iterated on them, post-processed them, or use AI-upscalers or anything. This is how they come out of my home PC 'raw'. It's funny because I can already feel how dated this is going to look in a few months.

This is an example of just how much you can extract the influence of a particular artist / designer / creative within a generalised data-set. I have all kinds of conflicting feelings about it.

But as a creative who has 'control' it's pretty thrilling. But I guess so is spraying a flame-thrower around; until you realise what you've done ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¿.

It's messed-up that the world's creativity is being hoovered up, fed to a computer, having interfaces put on it, and being flogged as a subscription for $9.99. And Dieter will never get a penny. And the disruption it's going to cause is going to be terrible for a lot of people.

But my inner optmist sees amazing potential for artists and technologists to work together. To create mind-blowing systems and tools and experiences. In ways that aren't trying to replace the creators, but to empower them and reward them for their contributions.

I'm hoping that interesting new companies spring up to do things like create co-operative GANs that reward artists for their work being part of the neural network - or pays them as their work gets referenced or passed through. Or some such nonsense. 

I don't know where this is going. But this stuff gets better and better at an **alaarming** rate. And I now beleive within 2 years we'll be able to generate images indesinguishable from todays stock photos. And within 3 or 4 years we'll be able to get to convincing video clips of the same quality. Imagine the computer for 'a bunch of dragons riding the waves like horses in that guiness ad but more cinematic in 3d featuring a track that sounds like Noisia featuring Brian Harvey' 30 seconds. Oh and give me something that will appeal to cider drinkers'.
