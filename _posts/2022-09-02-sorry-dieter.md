I'd been playing around with how to feed Stable Diffusion lettersforms and seeing if I could force it to bend things into shapes. More on that soon. But for some reason I wondered if it'd be possible to make objects or beautiful products in the shape of type.

One thing led to another and I'd generated a full alphabet of Rams-ian industrial design. So I whittled down the images I had and made a quick bosh through them...

These are all 'raw' as they come out of my computer at home. I haven't itterated them, post-processed them, or use AI-upscalers or anyhting. I probably should. But it probably shouldn't be anything more than an interesting proof of concept. And maybe it's useful as an example in some conversations around just how derivative data-sets can be.

Things are going to get pretty wild on this front over the next few years. And we need to make sure that all sides of the debate get represented and heard. 

I'm not saying this stuff is *bad*. But we can already see services that have hoovered up all the world's creativity and will sell it to you for $9.99 a month - and poor Dieter doesn't get a bean.
