AAIIINTT is Iain Tait sorted alphabetically. It was available. And I wanted a "new" thing.

I'm excited about [FOOD](https://food.xyz) - lots of exciting stuff going on over there.

But I also feel like i need to write more. I need an outlet for random chuff.

A few months ago Richard sent me this gem:

We've joked about it often since. But it's not entirely un-serious. Education and finding ways to impart what little knowlege we have onto a next generation of talent is a big part of what FOOD aspires to do. 

The idea of SKP has given me a kick up the arse to do this. And got me out of the paralysis of thinking it has to be 'for everyone'. Instead I'm blogging for a target audience of 1. It's 'younger me'. And maybe there will be some overspill. Don't count on it mind.

Like a true Knowledge Philanthropist I'm putting the site under a [CC-0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) which means:

This obviously doesn't mean if I embed the trailer to the new Marvel film you can rip that off - go and read [the exclusions on the link](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)... But if there's anything here that's useful, just take it... And let me know if you want more...

I'll talk more about 'why this madness?' over the coming weeks.
