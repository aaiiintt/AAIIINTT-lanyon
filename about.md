## Why is this blog called AAIIINTT

Well, short answer is: it's Iain Tait sorted alphabetically. I think it popped up during an odd coding exercise or something like that.

It shows how many A's and I's my parents gifted me. Proportionally anyway.

It's a bit odd. And quite geeky. Slightly awkward. And it's got some AI in it. Which seemed like a good fit.

## Why am I starting a blog like this in 2022?

Great question. I've got a post coming about that, and I'll update this page when I do.
